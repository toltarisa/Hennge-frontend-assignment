What did I did when creating this UI

- I used Creact React App package for this assignment.

- Then i integrated sass for styling by installing node-sass package.

- I created my folder structure for managing import/exports without pain

- I splitted UI elements to components as much as i can.

- I used css media queries when passing to mobile view.

- I used react-router-dom for navigation.

- I could've create this ui with vanilla js ,but it would take more time than creating with React.So i decided to finish it quickly.
